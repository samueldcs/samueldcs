### Hello there, I'm Samuel ðŸ‘‹

Brazilian, living in Porto Alegre, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. I firmly believe that professional programmers place best practices and solid architecture over specific technologies.

As a passionate developer, I embrace the principles of Agile and Software Crafting, undoubtedly benefiting from them on inclusive work environments by delivering quality products.

Besides evolving as a software craftsman through continuous improvement, my career goal is to propagate the values I believe in, contributing positively towards the evolution of the professional developer community.
